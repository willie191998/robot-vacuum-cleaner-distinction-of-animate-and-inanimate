# robot vacuum cleaner distinction of animate and inanimate obstacles
This code is designed for an Arduino UNO microcontroller and is part of a project to construct a robot vacuum. The vacuum operates using the S-path navigation algorithm and features motion detection using PIR sensors and limit switches/touch sensors. It's equipped with two TT DC motors for movement and separate motors for vacuuming and sweeping. Additional components include a buzzer, LED, and the AFMotor library for L293D motor driver control.

This code is a simplified form of the later advance code I had to build, this time using a MPU5060 IC. This was done because the robot beng two wheel could not move on a straight line has required because of inaccuracies in the motors so they don't make the same amount of turn per second. A MPU5060 sensor is a multi axix acceleration detector using internal accelerometer and gyroscopes. It detects the turn of the vacuum cleaner in the Z axis and makes adjustments in the turn of the movement motors to counter this turn. The result is that the vacuum cleaner moves in straight line.

I uploaded the simple algorithm here to start with if you want the advance algorithm using MPU sensor then email me at anoruewilson@gmail.com
